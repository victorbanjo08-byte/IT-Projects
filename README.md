# IT Projects Portfolio

Welcome! üëã  
This repository showcases my IT-related projects, homelabs, and simulations that demonstrate my skills in system administration, networking, technical support, and troubleshooting.  

I am passionate about problem-solving, continuous learning, and applying hands-on experience to real-world IT support and analyst roles. These projects reflect both my technical knowledge and my ability to translate that knowledge into practical solutions.
