# Active Directory Homelab

## Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to deploy and manage Active Directory in a virtualized environment.  
The lab simulates a small business environment with a domain controller and multiple client machines.  

## Tools & Technologies

## What I Did
1. Installed and configured Windows Server 2019 as a Domain Controller.
2. Created and managed user accounts and Organizational Units (OUs).
3. Configured Group Policy Objects (password policies, desktop restrictions).
4. Joined Windows 10 clients to the domain and verified authentication.
5. Tested permissions and security rules across users.

## Key Takeaways
- Hands-on experience managing a Windows Server environment.
